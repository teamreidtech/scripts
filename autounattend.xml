Holly, it's been nice to hear from you, I would have liked to catch up.  My wife and I have been together 22 years, married for 20, and our relationship has been complicated the last few years.  Right now it wouldn't be respectful of me to entertain a friendship with someone I once had a thing for.  Take care Holly.  =/
